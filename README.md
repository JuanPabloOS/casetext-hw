### 1. Ensure you are using node v22
```sh
node -v
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Run the application with the command:
```sh
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at port 3000 and should open automatically in your default browser

### 4. To test the different behaviors of the application like depositing, withdrawing or seeing the sprites change based on the user's card type, you can use the following NIPs:

Click the "Enter your NIP" button and enter one of these:
- 0001

# Casetext Homework Assignment
Your task in this challenge is to build a demo web app that is a functional ATM machine. Please use a stubbed backend as if you were interacting with a server (ie reading from a file or local storage). Feel free to add any bells and whistles you’d like.

## Guidelines:
- Please work in React, using Javascript or Typescript, and utilize any additional frameworks or libraries as needed.
- Incorporate state management effectively in your application.
- Utilize React hooks for managing state and side effects.
- Match the provided mocks as closely as possible.
- Please use provided assets.
- A user should be able to check their balance, withdraw funds, and deposit funds after entering their PIN at a minimum.
- Funds should be correctly reflected after a deposit or withdrawal.
- A user's card type should be highlighted once they have entered their correct PIN.
- Please put your code up on your GitHub account.
- Please include instructions about how we can run your app. (If your solution works better in one browser over the others, let us know which one.)

## Optional:
- While a backend is not required for this assignment, if you feel like it will help you, please create one. You may consider setting up a NodeJS backend server with Express to handle all transactions on the server.
